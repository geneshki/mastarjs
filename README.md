It's extremely easy to use and very effective when mastered. Therefore it was

# Trivia

While developing http://www.yetanotherprettifier.com/ I decided to use a
templating library for javascript that would help me generate some html client
side. However as many other things I didn't like the philosophy of the 
currently popular templating libraries and engines. That happens quite often
when I try to use someone else's code. Therefore I decided I'll do it myself!
